<p>This matter involves the interpretation of a will, the administration of the estate, and the application of dependent support claims under the Succession Law Reform Act.</p>
<p>The deceased appointed his second spouse as estate trustee. His children from a prior relationship contest both the appointment and the residue distribution, citing undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity.</p>
<p>The court found that the testator had capacity, but that significant financial provision was necessary for a dependent adult child who had not been explicitly named in the will.</p>
<p>Probate fees and executor compensation were also reviewed in light of the estateâ€™s complexity.</p>
<p>Paragraph about property boundaries and zoning was considered irrelevant to the estate administration.</p>
